    this is just a basic informational
    also, nothing in this program is final, everything is subject to change
    
    the basis of this program is that you can easily transfer information from
    sarah's sheets into a database
        the database then can be used to get back values in certain formats
        you can check which defenses an alliance can't pass
    
    this gives teams a score out of two 100-point catagories
    the subjective score
        this scores them on shooting, climbing, and an additional 10 points for personal opinion
    
    -----------EXAMPLE----------------
    Team A recieves a score of 6/10 on shooting, a checkmark for climbing, and 5/10 points for opinion
    so, (6/10)*40 + (*yes or no*)yes = 40 + 2(5/10)
    the grand total is: 24 + 40 + 10 = 74
    next you process the chemistry score...
       
    
    the chemistry score
        this scores them on how well they compliment the profile of the team using this program
        this also scores them on how WELL they can breach things. If they take too long,
        or they fail and need to retry multiple times, they are scored poorly
        
    the addition of both segments get you a total score (i.e. 134)
        teams with high scores will be displayed in final selection. 
            *remember the score includes how well they compliment the user, so a higher score means
            **both higher chemsitry and technical skills
    
    ideally this also keeps track of how many points they have scored (as an alliance)
        the teams that are the reason of the most scoring will stand out, as they will
        likely have the most amounts of points
   
    the way check() works in team.java is you check to see what the -
     (Team (object)) check(team1.getPassAuto<defense>())
